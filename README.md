# LiebLinigerKacMoody

This repository contains scripts and raw data for the paper *Kac-Moody symmetries in one-dimensional bosonic systems*.
More specifically,
- `scripts/BA-solutions`: using Bethe ansatz solutions, calculates the energy spectrum and the form factors for the Kac-Moody generators 
- `scripts/lieb-liniger-gs-and-excitations`: calculates the ground state and excited states with cMPS method
- `scripts/lieb-liniger-spectra`: calculates the form factors of the Kac-Moody generators with cMPS method, plot the energy spectrum 
- `scripts/benchmark`: performs a performance benchmark for the Riemannian optimization method of the circular cMPS
- `scripts/lieb-liniger-variance-of-N`: calculate the variance of `\hat{N}` operator in the ground state
